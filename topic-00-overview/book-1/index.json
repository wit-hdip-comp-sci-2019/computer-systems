This and subsequent labs have been developed and tested using **version 6.0.8**. To keep your development environment consistent with the labs, **you are advised to install this version**.\r\n\r\nSelect the appropriate download and install Virtualbox 6.0.8 for your operating system:\r\n\r\n- [Windows](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.8/VirtualBox-6.0.8-130520-Win.exe)\r\n- [OS X](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.8/VirtualBox-6.0.8-130520-OSX.dmg)\r\n- [Linux](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnsure that Virtualbox has installed correctly by starting the application on your machine.\r\n\r\nAll going well you should see something similar to the following:\r\n\r\n![VirtualBox.org](./img/virtualbox2.png)\r\n\r\nFor more information about Virtualbox and installation, have a look around the [website](https://www.virtualbox.org/). \r\n"

    "contentMd" : "# Disco Dingo!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n![Ubuntu 19.04](./img/dingo.PNG)\r\n\r\nUbuntu V 19.04 was released in April 2019 and is guaranteed to have supported security and maintenance updates until April 2024\r\n\r\n - Ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning ***humanity to others***. It also means ***I am what I am because of who we all are***.\r\n - Ubuntu is free/Libre Open-Source Software\r\n - Ubuntu is a computer operating system!!!\r\n - Ubuntu used the ***Linux kernel***\r\n\r\n**The Linux kernel on its own, is not an operating system, but rather a set of computer instructions, that enable communication between software applications and the data processing done at the hardware level.**\r\n\r\n## Recommended system requirements(Ubuntu):\r\n\r\n - 2 GHz dual core processor or better\r\n - 2 GB system memory or more\r\n - 25 GB of free hard drive space\r\n - The Ubuntu ***iso*** image file\r\n\r\n Also:\r\n\r\n - Internet access is helpful\r\n\r\n## What is an ***iso*** image file\r\n\r\nYou will actually be downloading  an **iso** image file. ISO images are often used to distribute large programs over the internet due to the fact that all of the program's files can be neatly contained as a single file.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this iso image, potentially you can:\r\n\r\n - Install or upgrade Ubuntu\r\n - Test out the Ubuntu desktop experience without touching your PC configuration\r\n - Boot into Ubuntu on a borrowed machine or from an internet cafe\r\n - Use tools installed by default on the USB stick to repair or fix a broken configuration\r\n\r\n##  Downloading Ubuntu 19.04\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload the latest version(19.04) via the [Ubuntu download page](https://www.ubuntu.com/#download). \r\n\r\n![Ubuntu 19.04](./img/download_LI.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox\r\n\r\nStart VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine by clicking the ***New*** icon\r\n\r\nWhen the New Virtual Machine Wizard appears, enter \"Ubuntu19.04\" for the name,  \"Linux\" for type, and  \"Ubuntu (64 bit)\" for version. You can leave the Machine folder as default setting if you want.\r\n\r\n![New Virtual Machine](./img/virtualbox.PNG)\r\n\r\n- Click **Next** and select how much memory you wish to allocate to the virtual machine (we recommend you give at least 2048MB. You can increase it later if it's sluggish).\r\n\r\n![Memory](./img/memory.PNG)\r\n\r\n- Click next and accept the default settings for the remaining options.\r\n\r\n- Finish the wizard by clicking the **Create** button.\r\n\r\n![Create VM](./img/create.PNG)\r\n\r\n The ***New Virtual Machine Wizard*** will close and you will be brought back to VirtualBox Manager.\r\n\r\n - Select the Virtual Machine you've just created and click ***Start***\r\n\r\n![Start Ubuntu](./img/start.PNG)\r\n\r\n## First Run Wizard\r\n\r\nThe \"First Run Wizard\" should now appear appear. \r\n\r\n_ Click Next button. On the second screen (as shown below), click at 'folder' icon and choose your Ubuntu iso file you downloaded earlier.\r\n ![Select your Ubuntu iso file you saved above](./img/iso.PNG)\r\n\r\nClick Start button to install Ubuntu. Like any OS installation, you will be asked a few configuration questions during the install process. Select the appropriate responses for language/time/keyboard etc.\r\n\r\n WELCOME TO UBUNTU!!!!\r\n\r\n# Tutorials, tips and tricks\r\n\r\nThere are many many tutorials and resources available online to assist. Ubuntu also has a comprehensive [Tutorial page](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/).\r\nDepending on your physical machine and environment, you may have to \"tweak\" Virtual Box and the Ubuntu instance to get it just right. Some common fixes of note including:\r\n\r\n- [Ubuntu is not working in Full Screen Mode (and a bunch of other additions)](https://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm) \r\n- [Failed to send host log message](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/502540/why-does-drmvmw-host-log-vmwgfx-error-failed-to-send-host-log-message-sh)\r\n\r\n"
