Place the shell commands (which we would normally type at the command prompt) into a file and \r\n2. then execute the file.\r\n"

    "contentMd" : "##Be careful of the Basics:\r\n\r\n1. Linux IS case sensitive so be careful with working with filenames and with commands\r\n2. Become familiar with naming conventions i.e. no spaces\r\n3. In Linux, the shell is a program that interprets commands & acts as an intermediary between the user and the inner workings of the OS. \r\n\r\n##We will use the Ubuntu Distribution \r\nThere are some basic exercises that we will complete from today's handout now.\r\n\r\n##Manual\r\n\r\nThere is a very comprehensive manual included which can be used simply by the ***man*** command, i.e. \r\n~~~~\r\nman ls\r\n~~~~\r\nwhich will return with the manual page for the ***ls*** command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples of some shell scripting commands:\r\n\r\n1. Suppose we need to find out the number of logged-in users several times throughout the day:\r\nThe Linux command would be as follows:\r\n~~~~\r\n    $ who | wc –l\r\n~~~~\r\nPlease note:\r\n  - This is the lowercase letter \" **l** \", not the number \"1\" \r\n  - Do NOT type the $ sign - this is just shorthand for the command line prompt\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this command is actually a combination of two commands, connected by a pipe.  \r\n\r\nA pipe is used to connect the output of one command to the input of another command. The vertical bar symbol **|** is used to specify a pipe.  In this example, the output of who is provided as input to the **wc –l** command.  who lists the users currently logged on, one per line.  **wc –l** counts the number of lines in its input.\r\n\r\nSo, to avoid having to re-type this command each time we wish to find out how many users are logged in, we will create a file called ***numusers***.\r\n\r\n## Creating a Shell Scripting File\r\n**nano** is a command-line text editor. \r\n**gedit** is a good graphical alternative\r\n\r\n1. We create the file\r\n~~~~\r\n    $nano numusers\r\n~~~~\r\n2. We type in the shell command\r\n~~~~\r\n    who | wc –l\r\n~~~~\r\n3. We save the file \r\n~~~~\r\n    CTRL+O\r\n~~~~\r\n4. And exit the file\r\n~~~~\r\n    CTRL+X\r\n~~~~\r\n5. To execute the commands contained in the file numusers, all you now have to do is type **./numusers** at the command line\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n    $ ./numusers\r\n\tbash: ./numusers: Permission denied\r\n\t$\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nSo what went wrong?  \r\n"

As an extension to the script above, use the shell script in conjunction with the file re-direction operator to redirect the output to a file called “***howmany***”\r\n~~~~\r\n    $ ./numusers > howmany\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n3.

Remember, spaces are **not** permitted on either side of the equals sign\r\n\r\n2. Unlike most programming languages the shell has ***no concept of data types***.\r\n\r\nWhenever you assign a value to a shell variable, no matter what it is the shell simply interprets that value as a string of characters. So when we stored the value 1 into the shell variable count above, the shell made no distinction whatsoever that an integer value was being stored in the variable.\r\n\r\n# Displaying the values of Variables\r\n\r\nUsing the ***echo*** command encountered above, we can display the value stored in a shell variable as follows:\r\n~~~~\r\necho $variable_name\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nThe shell recognises the **$** as a special character, if a valid variable name follows the ***$*** the shell understands that it is to substitute the value in place of the variable name.\r\n~~~~\r\n$ echo $count\r\n$ echo $mybin\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n# Program input\r\n\r\nUsing the ***read*** command allows us to get input form the user into a variable:\r\n\r\n***read variable_name***\t\t\t\r\n(note no ***$*** sign before variable name)\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n$ read number\r\n365\t(entered by user)\r\n$ echo $number\r\n365\t(output)\r\n~~~~"
